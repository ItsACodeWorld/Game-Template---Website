		<p>
			I will be creating a zombie survival game where users can interact with one another, trading supplies and other things I haven't thought up yet. <br />
			There will be quests the player can fulfill to gain supplies and experience. These quests take energy to do and may do damage to the player if they fail <br />
			With supplies, the user can build weapons, armor, or medicine <br />
			Weapons increase damage, Armor increases defense<br />
			Medicine can increase energy, hp, or other buffs <br />
			<br />
			Players can also fight one another, doing damage, stealing supplies, and gaining exp <br/>
			<br />
			The purpose is to gain a high level and become the ultimate zombie survivalist<br/>
			<br />
			<br />
			There may be more features added if I think of anything fun<br />
